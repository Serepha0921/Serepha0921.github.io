Hey! I’m Jaehyung — a developer who loves making games and exploring the intersection between code and design.

Whether I’m building a prototype, tweaking a UI layout, or figuring out how to make something “feel right,” I’m happiest when I’m creating. I enjoy combining logic with creativity — especially when it comes to interactive experiences.

This blog is where I keep track of side projects, study, and personal dev logs. I’m writing mainly for myself, but if you find something useful or interesting along the way, that’s a bonus!

Thanks for dropping by!
